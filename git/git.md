## To commit changed code

Do all the following commands, one at a time. Press Enter after each one. Below is an explanation of each one.

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Type your commit message here."
git push
```

1. Status. This tells you what new changes you have made. Like this: `git status`

2. Stage your files. This gets your changes ready to be committed. Like this: `git add .`

3. Commit your changes. Write a commit message that describes the changes. Like this: `git commit -m "Type your commit message here."`

4. Push your changes up to github.com, so that CBF staff can see them. Like this: `git push`
