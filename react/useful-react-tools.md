# Automatically responding to code changes with Live Server

- On command line: `npm install -g live-server`
- Then: `live-server`
    - This will automatically launch the default browser. When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.
